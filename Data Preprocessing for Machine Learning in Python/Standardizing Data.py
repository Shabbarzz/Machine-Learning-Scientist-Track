# Exercise_1
# Split the dataset and labels into training and test sets
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y)

# Fit the k-nearest neighbors model to the training data

# Exercise_2
# Print out the variance of the Proline column
print(wine["Proline"].var())

# Apply the log normalization function to the Proline column
wine["Proline_log"] = np.log(wine["Proline"])

# Check the variance of the normalized Proline column

# Exercise_3
# Import StandardScaler from scikit-learn
from sklearn.preprocessing import StandardScaler

# Create the scaler

# Apply the scaler to the DataFrame subset
